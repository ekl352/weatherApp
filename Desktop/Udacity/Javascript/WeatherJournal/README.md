# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

## To set up the correct work environment, in the terminal make sure your app.js file is within the folder with your index.html and css, and the server.js file is outside of that folder, but on the same level. Make sure node is installed by typing node -v. Make sure all your packages are installed by typing npm install package-name. So npm install boody-parser, npm install cors. Make sure node is up and running by typing in node server.js when you begin your project, then in the browser type localhost:3000 (or whatever your port is).
